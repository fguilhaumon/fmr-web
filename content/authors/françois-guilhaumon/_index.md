I’m a research scientist at **IRD**. I work at ENTROPIE, a lab located on la Réunion Island, France.

My research applies theoretical and methodological advances in biogeography and community ecology to conservation biology. I’m particularly interested in discovering and documenting the distribution of different aspects marine biodiversity and associated patterns of the human footprint. My goal is to integrate this knowledge at several spatial and temporal scales to help develop and deploy strategies for the conservation of biodiversity and the maintaining of ecosystems functionning.
